#### `variational_autoencoder.ipynb`
- Implementation of VAE using PyTorch, trained on celebA faces dataset.
- Making images smile, using both original image space and latent space arithmetic.
- `variational_autoencoder_checkpoint.pth` contains saved checkpoint after 10 epochs.

#### `gan_mnist.ipynb`
- Implementation of standard GAN on MNIST data. Used simple architecture and low learning rate for the discriminator to prevent it from becoming too good for the generator to learn.
